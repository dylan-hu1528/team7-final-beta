# Description
This peer evaluation ruby on rails application allows a user to sign up on the main page and access the class page that the user is assigned to.

Each user that is signed up for the peer evaluation tool can be assigned to a class and a team by the administrator. This administrator can create classes and teams within those classes.

Once in a class, a normal user(student) can see their class and team. They can then create evaluations for the team.

Administrators have additional privileges including adding/removing classes and teams as well as viewing peer feedback for students.
